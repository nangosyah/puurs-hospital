## Puurs Hospital Emergency Department Dashboard

An interactive analytics dashboard built with Python Dash for monitoring Emergency Department performance at Puurs Hospital. 

The dashboard tracks key operational metrics including staffing levels, patient wait times, door-to-doctor intervals, length of stay, LWBS rates, and clinical service utilization. 

Users can filter data by month and day range to explore trends over time and assess performance against predefined clinical targets: for example 40-min door-to-doctor time, ≤1% LWBS rate, 360-min length of stay.

All data used in this dashboard is synthetically generated for demonstration and educational purposes only. No real patient or hospital-level private data is included.
